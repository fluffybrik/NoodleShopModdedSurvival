## First time setup:

1. Run Minecraft 1.18.1 at least once.
   - After this step, make sure your Minecraft game and your launcher is closed.
3. Download [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) (click the big blue button) and run the installer. 
4. Download the mods by clicking the green "Code" button above and download as zip.
   - All mods listed below are included in the file. There's no virus i promis :)
   - Take note where you keep the `.zip` file. It's easiest to save it on your desktop.
5. Press your `Win` key (or do `Ctrl + R`) and type in "%appdata%" without parenthesis. Press enter.
6. Navigate to `.minecraft > mods` and unpack the `.zip` file there. 
   - To do this, open the `.zip`, navigate into the NSMS folder and simply drag and drop the contents into the `mods` folder. 
7. All set! Now open your launcher, make sure the Fabric loader is selected in the bottom-left corner, slap in our fancy server address, and yer done!
   - Don't worry if you get a scawry pop up! Everything is working as intended. 

Have any problems? Contact me (Nathan) in the Discord server!
